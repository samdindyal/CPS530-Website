# CPS530 Website

Hello, and welcome to my CPS530 repository. The website this repository corresponds to is a portfolio as a website that I have created to hold all of my lab assignments for a course I have taken at Ryerson University: Web Systems Development *(CPS530)*. I should note that, on the live site, my lab assignments are password protected. This was a requirement however if you would like to view them, please send me an email at <a href="mailto:sam.dindyal@icloud.com">sam.dindyal@icloud.com</a> and I'd be more than happy to provide you with the credentials.

My term project is also linked on this site however if you would rather see the source code for it, you can find it here:
<a href="https://github.com/samdindyal/CPS530-TermProject">https://github.com/samdindyal/CPS530-TermProject</a>

You can see it in action here:

Please feel free to look around.
